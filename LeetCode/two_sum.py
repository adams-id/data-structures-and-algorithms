"""
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

# Explanation
"""
Intuition -

To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array. If the complement exists, we need to get its index. 
What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index? A hash table.
We can reduce the lookup time from O(n) to O(1) by trading space for speed.
A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup in near constant time.
I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a lookup could degenerate to O(n) time.
However, lookup in a hash table should be amortized O(1) time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.

Algorithm

A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table.
Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement (target âˆ’ nums[i]) exists in the hash table. 
If it does exist, we return current element's index and its complement's index. Beware that the complement must not be nums[i] itself!
